# What's this?
This site serves as a place for me to post updates about the things I'm working on, for example [Raven Hack](http://ravenhack.org/). Unlike a lot of personal webpages, this is not a CV, as I already have a fairly robust [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgao22/). Feel free to check that out if you want to learn more about me.
