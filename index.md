# What's this?
This site serves as a place for me to post updates about the things I'm working on, for example [Raven Hack](http://ravenhack.org/). Unlike a lot of personal webpages, this is not a CV, as I already have a fairly robust [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgao22/). Feel free to check that out if you want to learn more about me. 

# Who am I?
I'm a high school student living in sunny San Diego!  I enjoy biology, coding, and entrepreneurship. When I'm not working on a research project or organizing an event, you'll most likely find me with my nose in a history book or studying some random language. 

# What am I doing?
Currently, I'm organizing San Diego's **First** free hackathon for all high schoolers, [Raven Hack](http://ravenhack.org/), which I co-founded.
