# What's this?
This site serves as a place for me to post updates about the things I'm working on, for example [Raven Hack](http://ravenhack.org/). The site is also a landing page to my [blog](https://blog.andrewg.me), where I will post about my experiences learning languages, being a teen entrepreneur, surviving high school, and more. I also occasionally put some resources I use or created on there. 
Unlike a lot of personal webpages, this is not a CV, as I already have a fairly robust [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgao22/). Feel free to check that out if you want to learn more about me. 

# Who am I?
I'm a high school student living in sunny San Diego!  I enjoy biology, coding, and entrepreneurship. When I'm not working on a research project or organizing an event, you'll most likely find me with my nose in a history book or studying some random language. 

# What am I doing?
Currently, I'm organizing San Diego's **First** free hackathon for all high schoolers, [Raven Hack](http://ravenhack.org/), which I co-founded. I'm also working at [Spark Teen](https://www.sparkteenmarket.com/) as a Regional President, helping run an youth entrepreneurship collaborative "night market" and pitchfest where we're awarding $1000 in prize money. Also, I'm an official ambassador for the Congressional App Challenge, encouraging students from diverse backgrounds to try out STEM. Similarly, I founded and coach an FLL and FTC robotics team, the first in my community, in order to let more kids get involved with robotics. Besides that, I'm involved in a few other things, which you can check out on my Linkedin.

# Why do I do what I do?
I'm super passionate about making STEM more accessible to all. As someone who would have never gotten into STEM without someone else introducing me to it, I understand how science can be intimnidating and seem like something just for super smart nerds. That's why I focus a large portion of my energy on somehow spreading STEM throughout my community.
